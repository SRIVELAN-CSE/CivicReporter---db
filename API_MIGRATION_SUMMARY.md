# API URL Migration Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ Created New API Constants File
- **File**: `lib/constants/api_constants.dart`
- **Purpose**: Centralized API configuration with deployed backend URL
- **Base URL**: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com`

### ✅ Updated Backend API Service  
- **File**: `lib/services/backend_api_service.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced localhost URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) with `ApiConstants.apiBaseUrl`
  - Updated all API endpoint calls to use centralized constants
  - Standardized timeout durations using `ApiConstants.connectionTimeout`
  - Improved maintainability by using predefined endpoint constants

### ✅ API Endpoints Updated
All endpoints now use the deployed Render URL:

**Authentication:**
- Login: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
- Register: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/auth/register`
- User Profile: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/users/{userId}`

**Reports:**
- Create Report: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/reports/`
- Get All Reports: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/reports/`
- Get User Reports: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/reports/user/{userId}`
- Update Report Status: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/api/reports/{reportId}/status`

**Health Check:**
- Health: `https://civicreporter-db.onrender.com/health`

### ✅ Configuration Benefits
- **Centralized Management**: All API URLs managed from one location
- **Easy Environment Switching**: Change base URL in one place for all endpoints
- **Consistent Timeouts**: Standardized connection and request timeouts
- **Maintainable Code**: Reduced hardcoded strings throughout the codebase

### ✅ Verification
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Flutter analyze passes (only style warnings remain)
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## Files Modified
1. `lib/constants/api_constants.dart` - **NEW FILE**
2. `lib/services/backend_api_service.dart` - **UPDATED**

## Next Steps
- Deploy the Flutter app to connect to the live backend
- Test all API endpoints with the deployed backend
- Monitor API performance and connection stability
