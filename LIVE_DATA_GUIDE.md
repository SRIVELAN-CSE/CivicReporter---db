# 🏛️ CIVIC WELFARE - LIVE DATA PERSISTENCE GUIDE

## ✅ YOUR APP ALREADY REMEMBERS EVERYTHING!

### 🔐 **User Authentication & Sessions**
```
When you login with email/password:
1. ✅ App checks credentials against SQLite database
2. ✅ Creates JWT authentication token  
3. ✅ Saves token + user info in browser localStorage
4. ✅ Even if you close the app and reopen - YOU STAY LOGGED IN!
```

### 📝 **New User Registration**  
```
When you register a new user:
1. ✅ User data saved permanently in SQLite database
2. ✅ Password securely hashed and stored
3. ✅ User can login immediately with their credentials
4. ✅ Account persists forever (until manually deleted)
```

### 📊 **Report Submission**
```
When you submit reports:
1. ✅ Report saved to SQLite database permanently
2. ✅ Copy cached in browser localStorage (for offline access)  
3. ✅ Data survives app closure, browser restart, computer restart
4. ✅ Accessible from any device with same login credentials
```

### 🎯 **Test Your Live Data Storage:**

#### Method 1: Through Backend API (Direct)
```bash
# Register new user
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com", 
    "password": "yourpassword123",
    "phone": "+919876543210",
    "location": "Your City",
    "user_type": "public"
  }'

# Login with new credentials  
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "password": "yourpassword123"
  }'
```

#### Method 2: Through Flutter App (Recommended)
```
1. 🚀 Run: flutter run -d chrome
2. 📝 Navigate to registration screen
3. ✍️ Fill in your real details:
   - Name: Your actual name
   - Email: Your real email  
   - Password: Choose a password
   - Phone: Your phone number
   - Location: Your city
4. 📋 Submit registration
5. 🔐 Login with your new credentials
6. 📊 Submit some reports
7. ❌ Close the app completely
8. 🔄 Reopen the app - YOU'LL STILL BE LOGGED IN!
```

### 💾 **Where Your Data Lives:**

#### 1. **SQLite Database (Permanent)**
- **File**: `backend/civic_welfare.db`
- **Contains**: Users, reports, notifications, sessions
- **Persists**: Forever (until file deleted)
- **Accessible**: From any device via API

#### 2. **Browser localStorage (Session Cache)**  
- **Location**: Browser's Local Storage for localhost
- **Contains**: User session, temporary data cache
- **Persists**: Until browser cache cleared
- **Purpose**: Fast access without API calls

### 🔍 **View Your Live Data:**

```bash
# See all users in database
cd backend
python display.py users

# See all reports  
python display.py reports

# See database summary
python data_summary.py
```

### 🎉 **The Magic:**

- **Register once** → Account saved forever
- **Login anywhere** → Session remembered  
- **Submit reports** → Data persists permanently
- **Close app** → Everything stays saved
- **Reopen app** → Still logged in with all your data!

### 🚀 **Your Next Steps:**

1. **Start backend**: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Start Flutter**: `flutter run -d chrome`  
3. **Register yourself** with real details
4. **Test the persistence** by closing and reopening
5. **Submit real reports** and see them persist

## ✨ Your app is ready for live data! Everything you create will be remembered! ✨
