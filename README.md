## 🔧 Core Features Deep Dive

### Smart Categorization System
```dart
// Automatic priority and department assignment
SmartCategorizationService.instance.determinePriority(
  title: "Water pipe burst emergency",
  description: "Major flooding on main street",
  category: "Infrastructure"
); // Returns: "Critical"

SmartCategorizationService.instance.determineDepartment(
  title: "Water pipe burst emergency", 
  description: "Major flooding on main street",
  category: "Infrastructure"
); // Returns: "Water Department"
```

### Multi-Platform Data Storage
```dart
// Automatically detects platform and uses appropriate storage
await DatabaseService.instance.saveReport(report);
// Web: Uses localStorage
// Mobile: Uses SharedPreferences
```

### Notification Workflow
```dart
// Admin approves password reset → User gets notification with action button
NotificationService.instance.createPasswordResetApprovedNotification(
  userEmail: "user@example.com",
  userName: "John Doe", 
  requestId: "reset_123"
);
// User sees: 🔔(1) → "Reset Password Now" button
```
